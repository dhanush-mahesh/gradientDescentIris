How to run code for Part 1:
	1. Run cells 1-15 from top to bottom
	2. Now for each different coefficients/trial, we must run those respectively.
	   Run Coefficients 1 Cell -> Scroll down -> Run Training RMSE for Coefficients 1 -> Scroll down -> Run Test RMSE for Coefficients 1
	3. After a specific trial is done running, Run cells 1-15 from top to bottom again(Easiest way: Run Before(Ctrl + F8) - will run all code from that cell you are on and everything above)
	4. Repeat step number 2 & 3 for Coefficients 2-5



How to run code for Part 2:
	1. Run cells 1-13 from top to bottom
	2. Now for each different trial, we must run those respectively.
	   Run Coefficients 1 Cell -> Scroll down -> Run Training RMSE for Coefficients 1 -> Scroll down -> Run Test RMSE for Coefficients 1
	3. After a specific trial is done running, Run cells 1-13 from top to bottom again(Easiest way: Run Before(Ctrl + F8) - will run all code from that cell you are on and everything above)
	4. Repeat step number 2 & 3 for Coefficients 2-5







*Note - All weighted coefficients, MSE and R^2 value are displayed in the respective python files.
